# ðŸ§  Building Smart Bots from Scratch â€” Level 1

## Current Level: Rule-Based Chatbot

In this level, we build a simple chatbot using:

- TF-IDF Vectorization of questions  
- Cosine Similarity to find the closest matching question  
- A custom question-answer dataset  

## Folder Structure

level-1-rule-based/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ chatbot.py # Core chatbot code
â”œâ”€â”€ ../data/conversation.csv # Dataset of QnA

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have required packages: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`  
2. Run `chatbot.py`  
3. Type your questions; type `exit` or `quit` to stop.

## Whatâ€™s Next?

- Improve chatbot intelligence using embeddings and transformers  
- Add natural language understanding for better context  
- Build multi-turn conversation capabilities

# ðŸ§  Building Smart Bots from Scratch

This repository is a step-by-step journey toward building intelligent chatbot systems â€” starting from scratch and gradually evolving into smarter, more advanced models.

## Project Overview

This project is structured in levels:

- **Level 1:** Rule-Based Chatbot (TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity)  
- **Level 2:** [To be developed: NLP embeddings, transformers...]  
- **Level 3:** [Future levels will add advanced AI techniques...]  

## Branching Strategy

- The **`main`** branch contains stable and tested versions of the project.  
- Each level is developed in its own branch (`level-1`, `level-2`, etc.) before merging into `main`.  

Stay tuned as the project evolves! ðŸš€
